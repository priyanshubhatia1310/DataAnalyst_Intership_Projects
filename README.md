### Project I :- REEL TASK - TABLEAU

âœ¨ Thrilled to present my first task , which i finished during my one month internship with Mentorness.

ðŸ”¶ I'm excited to present a quick video that explains coordinate-based visualization, such as maps and other visual aids. 

ðŸ“Š Plotting latitude and longitude/Customizing map layers/Geocoding addresses: Discussed spatial analysis capabilities, including plotting latitude and longitude coordinates, customizing map layers, and geocoding 
    addresses for mapping and geographic visualization.
    
ðŸ“Š Tableau maps provide a flexible and intuitive platform for analyzing and visualizing geographic data, enabling users to obtain insightful knowledge and make informed decisions. Tableau maps are an effective tool 
    for maximizing the value of geographic data, whether they are utilized for business analytics, spatial analysis, or storytelling.
