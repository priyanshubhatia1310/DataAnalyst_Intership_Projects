### Project I :- REEL TASK - TABLEAU

âœ¨ Thrilled to present my first task , which i finished during my one month internship with Mentorness.

ðŸ”¶ I'm excited to present a quick video that explains coordinate-based visualization, such as maps and other visual aids. 

ðŸ“Š Plotting latitude and longitude/Customizing map layers/Geocoding addresses: Discussed spatial analysis capabilities, including plotting latitude and longitude coordinates, customizing map layers, and geocoding 
    addresses for mapping and geographic visualization.
    
ðŸ“Š Tableau maps provide a flexible and intuitive platform for analyzing and visualizing geographic data, enabling users to obtain insightful knowledge and make informed decisions. Tableau maps are an effective tool 
    for maximizing the value of geographic data, whether they are utilized for business analytics, spatial analysis, or storytelling.

### Project II :- CORONA VIRUS ANALYSIS WITH SQL

The CORONA VIRUS pandemic has had a significant impact on public health and has created an urgent
need for data-driven insights to understand the spread of the virus. As a data analyst, you have been
tasked with analyzing a CORONA VIRUS dataset to derive meaningful insights and present your findings.

Description of each column in dataset:

1. Province: Geographic subdivision within a country/region.
2. Country/Region: Geographic entity where data is recorded.
3. Latitude: North-south position on Earth's surface.
4. Longitude: East-west position on Earth's surface.
5. Date: Recorded date of CORONA VIRUS data.
6. Confirmed: Number of diagnosed CORONA VIRUS cases.
7. Deaths: Number of CORONA VIRUS related deaths.
8. Recovered: Number of recovered CORONA VIRUS cases.

##### SQL Codes:-

ðŸ“£ In our coronavirus analysis project, we utilized SQL to examine spread of coronavirus all over the world. The project involved querying a database containing table for coronavirus cases and among other relevant data. To gather comprehensive insights, we employed SQL  functions to collect information from the table, such as coronavirus cases with there respective records. These SQL queries enable a comprehensive perspective on cases that exist in different part of the world.

âœ¨ We made use of sql functions and features to enhance our analysis. Aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() helped us calculate statistics such as average confirmed & recovered cases, total number of cases present & the total count of observations.

ðŸ”” Additionally, we made use of other sql functions to enhance our analysis. Functions like MIN(),MAX() to get the country having maximum and minimum number of recovered and death cases. We also use function like VARIANCE(),SQRT() to help us calculate statistics such as variance of death and confirmed cases & standard deviation of deaths and recovered  cases.

ðŸ“£ I'm thrilled to present my second project, which I finished during my one-month internship with Mentorness. 

âœ¨ In my second assignment, I had to use SQL to extract important information from a Corona Virus dataset. This data includes several columns, including confirmed, recovered, nation, and deaths.

ðŸ•¯ CONTENT:-
 1. Project Overview
 2. Data Description
 3. Analysis(Queries)
 4. Summary

ðŸ”” Through research of geographic trends, the project attempted to determine the majority of recovered cases, the majority of death cases, and factors influencing corona virus cases. It also examined the average, variance, and standard deviation of recovered and death cases.

### Project III:- HOTEL AGGREGATOR ANALYSIS WITH POWER BI

The dataset comprises various attributes related to listings, hosts, reviews, and availability. The objective is to create
comprehensive visualizations and insights that shed light on trends, patterns, and factors influencing the performance of listings. 
Through Power BI, interns will explore key metrics such as pricing, availability, host characteristics, and review scores to derive 
actionable insights for improving the overall quality and competitiveness of the listings.

Dataset Description:

1. id: Unique identifier for each listing.
2. listing_url: URL of the listing on the hotel aggregator platform.
3. scrape_id: Identifier for the data scraping event.
4. last_scraped: Date of the last data scrape.
5. source: Source of the listing information.
6. name: Name of the listing.
7. description: Description of the listing.
8. neighborhood_overview: Overview of the neighborhood where the listing is located.
9. picture_url: URL of the listing's picture.
10. host_id: Unique identifier for the host.
11. ... (and many more columns capturing details about hosts, location, property type, room details,
amenities, pricing, availability, reviews, and other relevant information)

Project Objectives:

1. Geographical Insights:
- Visualize the distribution of listings on a map to identify popular neighborhoods.
- Explore the geographical concentration of listings and host locations.
  
2. Pricing and Availability Analysis:
- Analyze pricing trends based on property types, room types, and accommodation capacity.
- Investigate the availability of listings over time and identify peak periods.
  
3. Host Performance:
- Evaluate host characteristics, including superhost status, response times, and verification methods.
- Explore correlations between host attributes and listing performance.
  
4. Review Scores and Guest Satisfaction:
- Examine review scores and their impact on overall listing performance.
- Identify areas for improvement based on specific review categories.
  
5. Property Type and Room Analysis:
- Analyse the distribution of property types and room types.
- Explore trends in the popularity of specific accommodation setups.

##### Power BI Report(PBIP Form):-

âœ¨ For my final assignment, I had to use Power Bi to extract important data from a dataset created by Hotel Aggregator. This data includes reviews, host_name, availability, longitude, latitude, and numerous other columns.

ðŸŒŸ It evaluate host characteristics, including superhost status, response times, and verification methods.Explore correlations between host attributes and listing performance.It visualizes the distribution of postings on a map to find popular neighborhoods by conducting research on geographic patterns.We can clear see that the report shows all the above objective is fulfilled.

ðŸ“£ I'm thrilled to present my final project, which I finished during my one-month internship with Mentorness. 

âœ¨ I had to utilize Power Bi to extract crucial data from a Hotel Aggregator dataset for my final task. Reviews, host_name , availability, longitude, latitude, and many other columns are included in this data.

ðŸŒŸ It visualizes the distribution of postings on a map to find popular neighborhoods by conducting research on geographic patterns. It examines pricing patterns according to the kinds of properties, kinds of 
    rooms, and number of accommodations .It also looked at review scores and how they affected the overall performance of the listings. It examines the distribution of room and property kinds. It has more 
   visuals as well.
